		<p align="justify">As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, other previously ignored viruses
		must be taken into account as causes of severe acute respiratory distress, influenza-like illness and pneumonia. In this article,
		we report two cases of pneumonia in chronic liver disease patients where human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E was identified as the
		only infecting pathogen. Both the patients presented with fever, cough and respiratory distress, along with radiological findings
		suggestive of pneumonia. Multiplex real-time PCR for various respiratory viruses (FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus) detected
		HCoV-229E in both cases. Both cases were managed with prophylactic antibiotics, steroids and supplemental oxygen therapy,
		after which they recovered completely and were discharged.</p>

<center><div class="myDiv"; align="left"><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></div></center>

<center><div class="myDiv"; align="left">
<p align="justify">Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses containing the largest genome among all RNA viruses. They have
	characteristic club-like projections of spike proteins on their surface, giving them the crown-like appearance for which they have
	been named (corona in Latin means crown) [1]. Aside from three deadly coronavirus species: severe acute respiratory syndrome
	(SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): four
	more known species of coronaviruses cause mild to moderate respiratory tract infections. These include human coronavirus
	(HCoV) 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63 and HCoV HKU1. Among these different known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E
	was identified earliest in 1966 and is mainly known to cause the common cold in adults [2, 3]. However, in children, elderly and
	immunocompromised patients it can cause severe lower respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis [4, 5]. In
	otherwise healthy patients, these less severe viral infections can lead to secondary bacterial infections or other viral co-infections
	by disrupting the normal respiratory epithelial lining and lowering immunity, which further worsens the situation [6]. Moreover,
	delay in presentation due to overlapping signs and symptoms and self-medication of antibiotics not only delays early diagnosis
	and proper management but also adds to the burden of drug resistance.</p>

	<h3>CASE REPORT</h3>
	<h4>Case 1</h4>
</div></center>

<center><div class="myDiv"; align="left">
	<p align="justify">A 50 to 60 year old patient presented to the emergency department with gradual onset of cough and mucoid expectoration, headache and fever up to 101 F for 3 days. He had decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver. He was also a chronic smoker
	with no other medical co-morbidities. He was not on steroids or any immunosuppressant medications. He had not taken any
	over-the-counter antibiotics or any other medications except for paracetamol 500mg for symptomatic relief and steam inhalation
	prior to hospital admission. On examination, there were diffuse rales present over the bilateral lung fields. His basic laboratory
	parameters are described in Table S1. Chest X-ray revealed right pleural effusion. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)
	of the chest showed multiple discrete rounded nodules, with areas of confluence in bilateral upper and right middle lobes and
	moderate right pleural effusion (Fig. 1). He was started on azithromycin and levofloxacin prophylactically.</p>

	<h4>Case 2</h4>

	<p align="justify">A 20 to 30 year old patient presented with abrupt onset of fever up to 102 F for 4days and gradual onset of breathlessness with
	productive cough for 2 days. He is a known case of alcoholic liver cirrhosis with jaundice, melaena and portal hypertension. He
	did not have any other comorbidities. There is no history of antibiotic or antiviral intake other than paracetamol 500mg for fever
	prior to the hospital admission. On examination, there was a bronchial breath sound with diffuse rales present over the bilateral
	lung fields. The patient’s basic laboratory parameters are presented in Table S1. Chest X-ray showed mild right-sided pleural
	effusion. HRCT of the thorax showed multiple small ill-defined nodules in bilateral lung fields along with ground-glass opacity
	in both lung fields and septal thickening in bilateral lower lobes (Fig. 2). RTPCR and rapid antigen testing for SARS COV 2
	were negative on admission and were repeated twice over a period of 5 to 6 days, and these were also negative. The patient was also
	negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p>
